# Chris's Conversion Compendium

Chris's Conversion Compendium is a Python terminal application that runs in the Code Institue mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can choose to convert units of Temperature, Length, Volume or Currency.

You can view the live version of the project here....

## How to use

Chris's Conversion Compendium is very intuitive to use. Upon running the program, a user is presented with four numerical choices with each type of parent conversion required displayed first.

When an option is selected, a user has to validate their choice, and then select a starting unit to convert. A user is then prompted to enter their numerical value to be converted. 

Upon hitting enter, the user is then presented with their original unit, and it's conversion into numerous selected popular outputs. The user is then asked would they like to carry out another conversion, or they can return to the main menu.

## Technologies Used

* [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) was used to produce the site flowchart
* User Input Validation was carried out using the third party module [PyInputPlus](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
* [Github](https://github.com/Chris-McGonigle) was used as the repository hosting service
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the Code Editor for the site
* Conversion rates were checked using [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/)

## Testing


## Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock Heroku terminal as follows:

1. Create the Gitpod repo via the Github template.
2. Log into Heroku and create a new app.
3. Set Heroku build packs to Python and NodeJS (in that order)
4. Link Github and Heroku accounts
5. Select the main repository and link to the Heroku app
6. Click on deploy.

## Credits

1. I viewed numerous Youtube Tutorials to assist in the production of the temperature conversion module, but specifically videos by [Parvat Computer Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW7vQ5h6_Yk), [Geek Tutorials](https://youtu.be/z-0CmOQAD2k), [NetSecProf](https://youtu.be/T67WzZ2HPpI) and [Dexter Learning](https://youtu.be/pCOkIMm2t70) were the most useful in the production of this section.

2. An article on [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/) introduced me to the [PyInputPlus](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) third party module which was created and is maintained by Al Sweigart. This module handles all of the user input validation for the interface.
